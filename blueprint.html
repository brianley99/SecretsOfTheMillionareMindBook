                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    We live in a world of duality: up and down, light and dark,
                    hot and cold, in and out, fast and slow, right and left. These
                    are but a few examples of the thousands of opposite poles. For
                    one pole to exist, the other pole must also exist. Is it possible
                    to have a right side without a left side? Not a chance.<br><br>
                    Consequently, just as there are “outer” laws of money, there
                    must be “inner” laws. The outer laws include things like
                    business knowledge, money management, and investment
                    strategies. These are essential. But the inner game is just as
                    important. An analogy would be a carpenter and his tools.<br><br>
                    Having top-of-the-line tools is imperative, but being the topnotch carpenter who masterfully uses
                    those tools is even more
                    critical.<br><br>
                    I have a saying: “It’s not enough to be in the right place at
                    the right time. You have to be the right person in the right place
                    at the right time.”<br><br>
                    So who are you? How do you think? What are your beliefs?
                    What are your habits and traits? How do you really feel about
                    yourself ? How confident are you in yourself ? How well do
                    you relate to others? How much do you trust others?<br><br>
                    Do you truly feel that you deserve wealth? What is your ability
                    to act in spite of fear, in spite of worry, in spite of inconvenience, in spite of discomfort? Can
                    you act when you’re not
                    in the mood?<br><br>
                    The fact is that your character, your thinking, and your
                    beliefs are a critical part of what determines the level of your
                    success.<br><br>
                    One of my favorite authors, Stuart Wilde, puts it this way:
                    “The key to success is to raise your own energy; when you do,
                    people will naturally be attracted to you. And when they show
                    up, bill ’em!”<br><br>

            <!--Why Is Your Money Blueprint Important?-->
            <article id="article-01" class="bg-article p-5 mt-3">
                <h2>Why Is Your Money Blueprint Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you heard of people who have “blown up” financially?
                    Have you noticed how some people have a lot of money and
                    then lose it, or have excellent opportunities start well but then
                    go sour on them? Now you know the real cause. On the
                    outside it looks like bad luck, a downturn in the economy, a
                    lousy partner, whatever. On the inside, however, it’s another
                    matter. That’s why, if you come into big money when you’re
                    not ready for it on the inside, the chances are your wealth will
                    be short-lived and you will lose it.<br><br>
                    The vast majority of people simply do not have the internal
                    capacity to create and hold on to large amounts of money and
                    the increased challenges that go with more
                    money and success. That, my friends, is the primary reason
                    they don’t have much money.<br><br>
                    A perfect example is lottery winners. Research has shown
                    again and again that regardless of the size of their winnings,
                    most lottery winners eventually return to their original financial state, the amount they can
                    comfortably handle.<br><br>
                    On the other hand, the opposite occurs for self-made millionaires. Notice that when self-made
                    millionaires lose their
                    money, they usually have it back within a relatively short time.<br><br>
                    Donald Trump is a good example. Trump was worth billions,
                    lost everything, and then a couple of years later, got it all back
                    again and more.<br><br>
                    Why does this phenomenon occur? Because even though
                    some self-made millionaires may lose their money, they never
                    lose the most important ingredient to their success: their
                    millionaire mind. Of course in “The Donald” ’s case, it’s his
                    “billionaire” mind. Do you realize Donald Trump could never
                    be just a millionaire? If Donald Trump had a net worth of only
                    1 million dollars, how do you think he’d feel about his
                    financial success? Most people would agree that he’d probably
                    feel broke, like a financial failure!<br><br>
                    That’s because Donald Trump’s financial “thermostat” is
                    set for billions, not millions. Most people’s financial thermostats are set for generating
                    thousands, not millions of dollars;
                    some people’s financial thermostats are set for generating
                    hundreds, not even thousands; and some people’s financial
                    thermostats are set for below zero. They’re frickin’ freezing
                    and they don’t have a clue as to why!<br><br>
                    The reality is that most people do not reach their full potential. Most people are not
                    successful.<br><br>
                    Research shows that 80
                    percent of individuals will never be financially free in the
                    way they’d like to be, and 80 percent will never claim to be
                    truly happy.<br><br>
                    The reason is simple. Most people are unconscious. They
                    are a little asleep at the wheel. They work and think on a superficial level of life—based only on
                    what they can see. They
                    live strictly in the visible world.<br><br>

            <!--The Roots Create the Fruits-->
            <article id="article-02" class="bg-article p-5 mt-3">
                <h2>The Roots Create the Fruits</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a tree. Let’s suppose this tree represents the tree of
                    life. On this tree there are fruits. In life, our fruits are called
                    our results. So we look at the fruits (our results) and we don’t
                    like them; there aren’t enough of them, they’re too small, or
                    they don’t taste good.<br><br>
                    So what do we tend to do? Most of us put even more attention and focus on the fruits, our
                    results.<br><br>
                    But what is it that
                    actually creates those particular fruits? It’s the seeds and the
                    roots that create those fruits.<br><br>
                    It’s what’s under the ground that creates what’s above the
                    ground. It’s what’s invisible that creates what’s visible. So what
                    does that mean? It means that if you want to change the fruits,
                    you will first have to change the roots. If you want to change
                    the visible, you must first change the invisible.<br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="wealth-principle">
                    <a href="./wealthPrincibles.html">
                        <h6>WEALTH PRINCIPLE:</h6>
                    </a>
                    <h6>If you want to change the fruits, you will first have to
                        change the roots. If you want to change the visible,
                        you must first change the invisible.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Of course, some say that seeing is believing. The question I
                    have for such people is “Why do you bother paying your electric bill?” Although you cannot see
                    electricity, you can certainly recognize and use its power. If you have any doubt as to
                    whether it exists, just stick your finger in an electric socket,
                    and I guarantee that your doubts will quickly disappear.<br><br>
                    In my experience, what you cannot see in this world is far
                    more powerful than anything you can see. You may or may
                    not agree with this statement, but to the extent that you do not
                    apply this principle in your life, you must be suffering. Why?<br><br>
                    Because you are going against the laws of nature, whereby
                    what is under the ground creates what is above the ground,
                    where what is invisible creates what is visible.<br><br>
                    As humans, we are a part of nature, not above it. Consequently, when we align with the laws of
                    nature and work on
                    our roots—our “inner” world—our life flows smoothly. When
                    we don’t, life gets rough.<br><br>
                    In every forest, on every farm, in every orchard on earth, it’s
                    what’s under the ground that creates what’s above the ground.
                    That’s why placing your attention on the fruits that you have
                    already grown is futile. You cannot change the fruits that are
                    already hanging on the tree. You can, however, change
                    tomorrow’s fruits. But to do so, you will have to dig below the
                    ground and strengthen the roots.<br><br>

            <!--The Four Quadrants-->
            <article id="article-03" class="bg-article p-5 mt-3">
                <h2>The Four Quadrants</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important things you can ever understand is
                    that we do not live on only one plane of existence. We live
                    in at least four different realms at once. These four quadrants
                    are the physical world, the mental world, the emotional world,
                    and the spiritual world.<br><br>
                    What most people never realize is that the physical realm is
                    merely a “printout” of the other three.<br><br>
                    For example, let’s suppose you’ve just written a letter on
                    your computer. You hit the print key and the letter comes out
                    of your printer. You look at your hard copy, and lo and
                    behold, you find a typo. So you take out your trusty eraser and
                    rub out the typo. Then you hit print again and out comes the
                    same typo.<br><br>
                    Oh my gosh, how could this be? You just erased it! So this
                    time you get a bigger eraser and you rub even harder and
                    longer. You even study a three-hundred-page manual called
                    Effective Erasing. Now you’ve got all the “tools” and knowledge
                    you need. You’re ready. You hit print and there it is again! “No
                    way!” you cry out, stunned in amazement. “How could this
                    be? What’s going on here? Am I in the twilight zone?”
                    What’s going on here is that the real problem cannot be
                    changed in the “printout,” the physical world; it can only be
                    changed in the “program,” the mental, emotional, and spiritual
                    worlds.<br><br>
                    Money is a result, wealth is a result, health is a result, illness
                    is a result, your weight is a result. We live in a world of cause
                    and effect.

                    Have you ever heard someone assert that a lack of money
                    was a bit of a problem? Now hear this: A lack of money is
                    never, ever, ever a problem. A lack of money is merely a
                    symptom of what is going on underneath.<br><br>
                    Lack of money is the effect, but what is the root cause? It
                    boils down to this. The only way to change your “outer” world
                    is to first change your “inner” world.<br><br>
                    Whatever results you’re getting, be they rich or poor, good
                    or bad, positive or negative, always remember that your outer
                    world is simply a reflection of your inner world. If things
                    aren’t going well in your outer life, it’s because things aren’t
                    going well in your inner life. It’s that simple.<br><br>

            <!--Declarations: A Powerful Secret for Change-->
            <article id="article-04" class="bg-article p-5 mt-3">
                <h2>Declarations: A Powerful Secret for Change</h2>
                <p>
                    In my seminars we use “accelerated learning” techniques that
                    allow you to learn faster and remember more of what you
                    learn. The key is “involvement.” Our approach follows from
                    the old saying “What you hear, you forget; what you see, you
                    remember; what you do, you understand.”<br><br>
                    So I’m going to ask that every time you reach the end of a
                    major principle in this book, you first put your hand on your
                    heart, then make a verbal “declaration,” then touch your head
                    with your index finger and make another verbal “declaration.”<br><br>
                    What’s a declaration? It’s simply a positive statement that you
                    make emphatically, out loud.<br><br>
                    Why are declarations such a valuable tool? Because everything is made of one thing: energy. All
                    energy travels in frequencies and vibrations. Therefore, each declaration you make
                    carries its own vibrational frequency. When you state a
                    declaration aloud, its energy vibrates throughout the cells of
                    your body, and by touching your body at the same time, you
                    can feel its unique resonance. Declarations not only send a
                    specific message to the universe, they also send a powerful
                    message to your subconscious mind.<br><br>
                    The difference between a declaration and an affirmation is
                    slight, but in my mind, powerful. The definition of an
                    affirmation is “a positive statement asserting that a goal you
                    wish to achieve is already happening.” The definition of a
                    declaration is “to state an official intention to undertake a
                    particular course of action or adopt a particular status.”<br><br>
                    An affirmation states that a goal is already happening. I’m
                    not crazy about this because, often when we affirm something
                    that is not yet real, the little voice in our head usually responds
                    with “This isn’t true, this is BS.”<br><br>
                    On the other hand, a declaration is not saying something is
                    true, it’s stating that we have an intention of doing or being
                    something. This is a position the little voice can buy, because
                    we’re not stating it’s true right now, but again, it’s an intention
                    for us in the future.<br><br>
                    A declaration, by definition, is also official. It is a formal
                    statement of energy into the universe and throughout your
                    body.<br><br>
                    Another word from the definition is important—action. You
                    must take all the actions necessary to make your intention a
                    reality.<br><br>
                    I recommend that you state your declarations aloud each
                    morning and each evening. Doing your declarations while
                    looking into a mirror will accelerate the process even more.<br><br>
                    Now I have to admit that when I first heard of all this, I
                    said, “No way. This declaration stuff is far too hokey for me.”
                    But because I was broke at the time, I decided, “What the
                    heck, it can’t hurt,” and started doing them. Now I’m rich, so
                    it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that I believe that
                    declarations really work.<br><br>
                    Either way, I’d rather be really hokey and really rich than
                    really cool and really broke. How about you?
                    That said, I invite you to place your hand on your heart and
                    repeat the following...<br><br>

                <h2>What Is Your Money Blueprint
                    and How Is It Formed?</h2>
                <p>
                    Whether I’m appearing on radio or television, I’m well-known
                    for making the following statement: “Give me five minutes,
                    and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life.”<br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="wealth-principle">
                    <a>
                        <h6>WEALTH PRINCIPLE:</h6>
                    </a>
                    <h5>Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial
                        future for the rest of your life.</h5>
                </div>
                <p>
                    How? In a short conversation, I can identify what’s called your
                    money and success “blueprint.” Each of us has a per-
                    sonal money and success blueprint already embedded in our
                    subconscious mind. And this blueprint, more than anything
                    and everything else combined, will determine your financial
                    destiny.<br><br>
                    What is a money blueprint? As an analogy, let’s consider the
                    blueprint for a house, which is a preset plan or design for that
                    particular home. In the same way, your money blueprint is
                    simply your preset program or way of being in relation to
                    money.<br><br>
                    I want to introduce you to an extremely important formula.<br><br>
                    It determines how you create your reality and wealth. Many of
                    the most respected teachers in the field of human potential
                    have used this formula as a foundation for their teachings.
                    Called the Process of Manifestation, it goes like this:<br><br>
                    T→F→A = R<br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="wealth-principle">

                    <h6>Thoughts lead to feelings. Feelings lead to actions.
                        Actions lead to results.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>
                Your financial blueprint consists of a combination of your
                thoughts, feelings, and actions in the arena of money.<br><br>
                So how is your money blueprint formed? The answer is
                simple. Your financial blueprint consists primarily of the information or “programming” you received
                in the past, and
                especially as a young child.<br><br>
                Who were the primary sources of this programming or
                conditioning? For most people, the list includes parents, sib-
                lings, friends, authority figures, teachers, religious leaders,
                media, and your culture, to name a few.<br><br>
                Let’s take culture. Isn’t it true that certain cultures have one
                way of thinking and dealing with money, while other cultures
                have a different approach? Do you think a child comes out of
                the womb with his or her attitudes toward money, or do you
                believe the child is taught how to deal with money? That’s right.<br><br>
                Every child is taught how to think about and act in relation to
                money.<br><br>
                The same holds true for you, for me, for everyone. You
                were taught how to think and act when it comes to money.
                These teachings become your conditioning, which becomes
                automatic responses that run you for the rest of your life.<br><br>
                Unless, of course, you intercede and revise your mind’s money
                files. This is exactly what we are going to do in this book, and
                what we do for thousands of people each year, on a deeper
                and more permanent level at the Millionaire Mind Intensive
                Seminar.<br><br>
                We said earlier that thoughts lead to feelings, that feelings
                lead to actions, that actions lead to results. So here’s an interesting question: Where do your
                thoughts come from? Why do
                you think differently from the next person?
                Your thoughts originate from the “files of information” you
                have in the storage cabinets of your mind. So where does this
                information come from? It comes from your past
                programming. That’s right, your past conditioning determines
                every thought that bubbles up in your mind. That’s why it’s
                often referred to as the conditioned mind.<br><br>
                To reflect this understanding, we can now revise our
                Process of Manifestation in the following manner:<br><br>
                P→T→F→A = R<br><br>
                Your programming leads to your thoughts; your thoughts
                lead to your feelings; your feelings lead to your actions; your
                actions lead to your results.<br><br>
                Therefore, just as is done with a personal computer, by
                changing your programming, you take the first essential step to
                changing your results.<br><br>
                So how are we conditioned? We are conditioned in three
                primary ways in every arena of life, including money:
                Verbal programming: What did you hear when you were
                young?<br><br>
                Modeling: What did you see when you were young?
                Specific incidents: What did you experience when you were
                young?<br><br>
                The three aspects of conditioning are important to understand, so let’s go over each of them. In
                Part II of this book,
                you will learn how to recondition yourself for wealth and
                success.<br><br>

            <!--The First Influence: Verbal Programming-->
            <article id="article-06" class="bg-article p-5 mt-3">
                <h2>The First Influence: Verbal Programming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let’s begin with verbal programming. What did you hear about
                    money, wealth, and rich people when you were growing up?
                    Did you ever hear phrases like money is the root of all evil, save
                    your money for a rainy day, rich people are greedy, rich people are
                    criminals, filthy rich, you have to work hard to make money, money
                    doesn’t grow on trees, you can’t be rich and spiritual, money doesn’t buy
                    happiness, money talks, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, that’s
                    not for people like us, not everyone can be rich, there’s never enough, and
                    the infamous we can’t afford it ?<br><br>
                    In my household, every time I asked my father for any
                    money I’d hear him scream, “What am I made of... money?”
                    Jokingly I’d respond, “I wish. I’ll take an arm, a hand, even a
                    finger.” He never laughed once.<br><br>
                    Here’s the rub. All the statements you heard about money
                    when you were young remain in your subconscious mind as
                    part of the blueprint that is running your financial life.<br><br>
                    Verbal conditioning is extremely powerful. For example,
                    when my son, Jesse, was three years old, he ran over to me and
                    excitedly said, “Daddy, let’s go see the Ninja Turtle movie. It’s
                    playing near us.” For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out how
                    this toddler could already be a master of geography. A couple
                    of hours later, I got my answer in the form of a TV
                    commercial advertising the movie, which had at the end the
                    usual tagline: “Now playing at a theater near you.”<br><br>
                    Another example of the power of verbal conditioning came
                    at the expense of one of our Millionaire Mind seminar
                    participants. Stephen didn’t have a problem earning money; his
                    challenge was keeping it.<br><br>
                    At the time Stephen came to the course he was earning over
                    $800,000 a year and had been doing so for the past nine years.
                    Yet he was still barely scraping by. Somehow, he managed to
                    spend his money, lend it, or lose it all by making poor
                    investment decisions. Whatever the reason, his net worth was
                    exactly zero!<br><br>
                    Stephen shared with us that when he was growing up, his
                    mom always used to say, “Rich people are greedy. They make
                    their money off the sweat of the poor. You should have just
                    enough to get by. After that you’re a pig.”<br><br>
                    It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what was
                    going on inside Stephen’s subconscious mind. No wonder he
                    was broke. He was verbally conditioned by his mother to
                    believe that rich people are greedy. Therefore, his mind linked
                    up rich with greedy, which of course is bad. Since he didn’t
                    want to be bad, subconsciously he couldn’t be rich.<br><br>
                    Stephen loved his mom and didn’t want her to disapprove
                    of him. Obviously, based on her beliefs, if he were to get rich,
                    she wouldn’t approve. Therefore, the only thing for him to do
                    was to get rid of any extra money beyond just getting by,
                    otherwise he’d be a pig!<br><br>
                    Now, you would think that in choosing between being rich
                    and being approved of by Mom or anyone else for that matter,
                    most people would take being rich. Not a chance! The mind
                    just doesn’t work that way. Sure, riches would seem to be the
                    logical choice. But when the subconscious mind must choose between
                    deeply rooted emotions and logic, emotions will almost always win.<br><br>

                <p>
                    Let’s get back to our story. In less than ten minutes at the
                    course, using some extremely effective experiential techniques,
                    Stephen’s money blueprint changed dramatically. In only two
                    years, he went from being broke to becoming a millionaire.<br><br>
                    At the course, Stephen began to understand that these
                    nonsupportive beliefs were his mom’s, based on her past programming, and not his. We then took it a
                    step further and
                    helped him to create a strategy whereby he wouldn’t lose his
                    mother’s approval if he got rich. It was simple.<br><br>
                    His mom loved Hawaii. So Stephen invested in a beachfront condo on Maui. He sends her there for the
                    entire winter.<br><br>
                    She’s in heaven, and so is he. First, she now loves that he’s
                    rich and tells everyone how generous he is. Second, he doesn’t
                    have to deal with her for six months of the year. Brilliant!
                    In my own life, after a slow start, I began doing well in
                    business but never seemed to make money with my stocks. In
                    becoming aware of my money blueprint, I recalled that when I
                    was young, each day after work, my dad would sit down at the
                    dinner table with the newspaper, check the stock pages, slam
                    his fist on the table, and shout, “Those stinkin’ stocks!” He
                    then spent the next half hour ranting about how stupid the
                    whole system is and how you have a better chance of making
                    money playing the slot machines in Las Vegas.<br><br>
                    Now that you understand the power of verbal conditioning,
                    can you see that it’s no wonder I couldn’t make any money in
                    the stock market? I was literally programmed to fail,
                    programmed to unconsciously pick the wrong stock, at the
                    wrong price, at the wrong time. Why? To subconsciously
                    validate my money blueprint that said, “Stocks stink!”<br><br>
                    All I can say is, by digging out this massive, toxic weed from
                    my inner “financial garden,” I began getting inundated with
                    more fruits! Virtually the day after I reconditioned myself, the
                    stocks I chose began to boom, and I’ve continued to have
                    amazing success in the stock market ever since. It seems
                    incredibly strange, but when you really understand how the
                    money blueprint works, it makes perfect sense.<br><br>
                    Again, your subconscious conditioning determines your
                    thinking. Your thinking determines your decisions, and your
                    decisions determine your actions, which eventually determine
                    your outcomes.<br><br>
                    There are four key elements of change, each of which is
                    essential in reprogramming your financial blueprint. They are
                    simple but profoundly powerful.<br><br>
                    The first element of change is awareness. You can’t change
                    something unless you know it exists.
                    The second element of change is understanding. By understanding where your “way of thinking”
                    originates, you can
                    recognize that it has to come from outside you.<br><br>
                    The third element of change is disassociation. Once you
                    realize this way of thinking isn’t you, you can separate yourself
                    from it and choose in the present whether to keep it or let it
                    go—based on who you are today, and where you want to be
                    tomorrow. You can observe this way of thinking and see it for
                    what it is, a “file” of information that was stored in your mind
                    a long, long time ago and may not hold any truth or value for
                    you anymore.<br><br>
                    The fourth element of change is reconditioning. We will begin
                    this process in Part II of this book, where we will introduce
                    you to the mental files that generate wealth. Should you want
                    to take this a step further, I invite you to attend the Millionaire
                    Mind Intensive Seminar, where you will be led through a series
                    of powerful experiential techniques that will rewire your
                    subconscious on a cellular and permanent level—retraining
                    your mind to respond supportively in terms of money and
                    success.<br><br>
                    Meanwhile, let’s go back to our discussion on verbal conditioning and the steps you can take now to
                    begin revising
                    your money blueprint.<br><br>

                <h2>The Second Influence: Modeling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The second way we are conditioned is called modeling. What
                    were your parents or guardians like in the arena of money
                    when you were growing up? Did one or both of them manage
                    their money well or did they mismanage it? Were they
                    spenders or savers? Were they shrewd investors or were they
                    noninvestors? Were they risk takers or conservative?
                    Was money consistently there or was the flow more sporadic?
                    Did money come easily in your family, or was it always a
                    struggle? Was money a source of joy in your household or the
                    cause of bitter arguments?<br><br>
                    Why is this information important? You’ve probably heard
                    the saying “Monkey see, monkey do.” Well, humans aren’t far
                    behind. As kids, we learn just about everything from modeling.
                    Although most of us would hate to admit it, there’s more
                    than a grain of truth in the old saying “The apple doesn’t fall
                    too far from the tree.”<br><br>
                    This reminds me of the story about a woman who prepares
                    a ham for dinner by cutting off both ends. Her bewildered
                    husband asks why she cuts off the ends. She replies, “That’s
                    how my mom cooked it.” Well, it just so happened that her
                    mom was coming for dinner that night. So they asked her why
                    she cut off the ends of the ham. Mom replies, “That’s how my
                    mom cooked it.” So they decide to call Grandma on the phone
                    and ask why she cut off the ends of the ham. Her answer?
                    “Because my pan was too small!”<br><br>
                    The point is that generally speaking, we tend to be identical
                    to one or a combination of our parents in the arena of money.<br><br>
                    For example, my dad was an entrepreneur. He was in the
                    home-building business. He built anywhere from a dozen to a
                    hundred homes per project. Each project took a huge amount
                    of capital investment. My dad would have to put up everything
                    we had and borrow heavily from the bank until the homes
                    were sold and the cash came through. Consequently, at the
                    beginning of each project, we had no money and were in debt
                    up to our eyeballs.<br><br>
                    As you can imagine, during this period my dad was not in
                    the best of moods nor was generosity his strong suit. If I asked
                    him for anything that cost even a penny, his standard reply
                    after the usual “What am I, made of money?” was “Are you
                    crazy?” Of course, I wouldn’t get a dime, but what I would get
                    was that “Don’t even think of asking again” glare. I’m sure you
                    know the one.<br><br>
                    This scenario would last for about a year or two until the
                    homes were finally sold. Then, we’d be rolling in dough. All of
                    a sudden, my dad was a different person. He’d be happy, kind,
                    and extremely generous. He’d come over and ask me if I
                    needed a few bucks. I felt like giving him his glare back, but I
                    wasn’t that stupid so I just said, “Sure, Dad, thanks,” and
                    rolled my eyes.<br><br>
                    Life was good... until that dreaded day when he’d come
                    home and announce, “I found a good piece of land. We’re
                    going to build again.” I distinctly remember saying, “Great,
                    Dad, good luck,” as my heart sank, knowing the struggle that
                    was about to unfold again.<br><br>
                    This pattern lasted from the time I could remember, when I
                    was about six, until the age of twenty-one, when I moved out
                    of my parents’ house for good. Then it stopped, or so I
                    thought.<br><br>
                    At twenty-one years of age, I finished school and became,
                    you guessed it, a builder. I then went on to several other types
                    of project-based businesses. For some strange reason, I’d
                    make a small fortune, but just a short time later, I’d be broke.
                    I’d get into another business and believe I was on top of the
                    world again, only to hit bottom a year later.<br><br>
                    This up-and-down pattern went on for nearly ten years
                    before I realized that maybe the problem wasn’t the type of
                    business I was choosing, the partners I was choosing, the
                    employees I had, the state of the economy, or my decision to
                    take time off and relax when things were going well. I finally
                    recognized that maybe, just maybe, I was unconsciously reliving my dad’s up-and-down income pattern.<br><br>
                    All I can say is, thank goodness I learned what you’re
                    learning in this book and was able to recondition myself out of
                    that “yo-yo” model and into having a consistently growing
                    income. Today, the urge to change when things are going well
                    (and to sabotage myself in the process) still comes up. But
                    now, there’s another file in my mind that observes this feeling
                    and says, “Thank you for sharing; now let’s get refocused and
                    back to work.”<br><br>
                    Another example comes from one of my seminars in Orlando, Florida. As usual, people were filing up
                    to the stage, one
                    by one, to get an autograph and say hello or thank you or
                    whatever. I’ll never forget one older gentleman because he
                    came up sobbing. He could barely catch his breath and kept
                    wiping his tears with his sleeve. I asked him what was wrong.<br><br>
                    He said, “I’m sixty-three years old and I’ve been reading books
                    and going to seminars since they were invented. I’ve seen
                    every speaker and tried everything they taught. I’ve tried
                    stocks, real estate, and been in over a dozen different
                    businesses. I went back to university and got an MBA. I’ve got
                    more knowledge than ten average men, yet I’ve never made it
                    financially. I’d always get a good start but end up emptyhanded, and in all those years I never knew
                    why. I thought I
                    must just be plain old stupid... until today.<br><br>
                    “Finally, after listening to you and doing the processes, it all
                    makes sense. There’s nothing wrong with me. I just had my
                    dad’s money blueprint stuck in my head and that’s been my
                    nemesis. My dad went through the heart of the Depression
                    era. Every day he would try getting jobs or selling things and
                    come home empty-handed. I wish I would have
                    understood modeling and money patterns forty years ago.<br><br>
                    What a waste of time, all that learning and knowledge has
                    been.” He began to cry even harder.<br><br>
                    I replied, “No way is your knowledge a waste of time! It has
                    just been latent, waiting in a ‘mind’ bank, waiting for the
                    opportunity to come out. Now that you’ve formulated a
                    ‘success blueprint,’ everything you’ve ever learned will become
                    usable and you will skyrocket to success.”<br><br>
                    For most of us, when we hear the truth, we know it. He
                    started to lighten up and began breathing deeply again. Then a
                    big grin came across his face. He gave me the biggest hug and
                    said, “Thank you, thank you, thank you.” Last I heard from
                    him, everything was booming: he has accumulated more
                    wealth in the last eighteen months than in the past eighteen
                    years combined. I love it!
                    Again, you can have all the knowledge and skills in the
                    world, but if your “blueprint” isn’t set for success, you’re financially doomed.<br><br>
                    We often get seminar participants whose parents were involved in World War II or who lived through
                    the Depression.<br><br>
                    These people are often in shock when they realize how much
                    their parents’ experiences have influenced their beliefs and
                    habits around money. Some spend like crazy because “You
                    could easily lose all your money, so you might as well enjoy it
                    while you can.” Others go the opposite route: they hoard their
                    money and “save for a rainy day.”<br><br>
                    A word of wisdom: Saving for a rainy day might sound like
                    a good idea, but it can create big problems. One of the
                    principles we teach in another of our courses is the power of
                    intention. If you are saving your money for a rainy day, what
                    are you going to get? Rainy days! Stop doing that. Instead of
                    saving for a rainy day, focus on saving for a joyous day or for
                    the day you win your financial freedom. Then, by virtue of the
                    law of intention, that’s exactly what you will get.<br><br>
                    Earlier we said that most of us tend to be identical to one or
                    both parents in the arena of money, but there’s also the flip
                    side of the coin. Some of us end up being exactly the opposite
                    of one or both parents. Why would that happen? Do the
                    words anger and rebellion ring a bell? In short, it just depends on
                    how ticked off you were at them.<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, as little kids we can’t say to our parents,
                    “Mom and Dad, have a seat. I’d like to discuss something with
                    you. I’m not fond of the way you’re managing your money or,
                    for that matter, your lives, and therefore, when I become an
                    adult, I’ll be doing things quite differently. I hope you
                    understand. Good night now and pleasant dreams.”<br><br>
                    No, no, no, it doesn’t go quite that way. Instead, when our
                    buttons are pushed, we generally freak out and what comes
                    out sounds more like “I hate you. I’ll never be like you. When
                    I grow up, I’m gonna be rich. Then I’ll get whatever I want
                    whether you like it or not.” Then we run to our bedroom, slam
                    the door, and start pounding our pillow or whatever else is at
                    hand, to vent our frustration.<br><br>
                    Many people who come from poor families become angry
                    and rebellious about it. Often they either go out and get rich or
                    at least have the motivation to do so. But there’s one little
                    hiccup, which is actually a big burp. Whether such people get
                    rich or work their buns off trying to become successful, they
                    are not usually happy. Why? Because the root of their wealth
                    or motivation for money is anger and resentment.<br><br>
                    Consequently, money and anger become linked in their minds,
                    and the more money such individuals have or strive for, the
                    angrier they get.<br><br>
                    Eventually, the higher self says, “I’m tired of being angry
                    and stressed out. I just want to be peaceful and happy.” So
                    they ask the same mind that created the link what to do about
                    this situation. To which their mind answers, “If you want to
                    get rid of your anger, you’re going to have to get rid of your
                    money.” So they do. They subconsciously get rid of their
                    money.<br><br>
                    They overspend or make a poor investment decision or get
                    a financially disastrous divorce, or they sabotage their success
                    in some other way. But no matter, because now these folks are
                    happy. Right? Wrong! Things are even worse because now
                    they’re not just angry, they’re broke and angry. They got rid of
                    the wrong thing!<br><br>
                    They got rid of the money instead of the anger, the fruit
                    instead of the root. Meanwhile, the real issue is, and always
                    was, the anger between them and their parents. And until that
                    anger is resolved, they will never be truly happy or peaceful
                    regardless of how much money they have or don’t have.<br><br>
                    The reason or motivation you have for making money or
                    creating success is vital. If your motivation for acquiring
                    money or success comes from a nonsupportive root such as
                    fear, anger, or the need to “prove” yourself, your money will
                    never bring you happiness.<br><br>

                        <h6>WEALTH PRINCIPLE:</h6>
                    </a>
                    <h6>If your motivation for acquiring money or success
                    comes from a nonsupportive root such as fear,
                    anger, or the need to “prove” yourself, your money
                    will never bring you happiness.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Why? Because you can’t solve any of these issues with
                    money. Take fear, for instance. During my seminars I ask the
                    audience, “How many of you would cite fear as your primary
                    motivation for success?” Not many people put up their hand.<br><br>
                    However, then I ask, “How many of you would cite security as
                    one of your main motivators for success?” Almost everyone
                    puts up his or her hand. But get this—security and fear are
                    both motivated by the same thing. Seeking security comes from
                    insecurity, which is based in fear.<br><br>
                    So, will more money dissolve the fear? You wish! But the
                    answer is absolutely not. Why? Because money is not the root
                    of the problem; fear is. What’s even worse is that fear is not
                    just a problem, it’s a habit. Therefore, making more money will
                    only change the kind of fear we have. When we were broke,
                    we were most likely afraid we’d never make it or never have
                    enough. Once we make it, however, our fear usually changes
                    to “What if I lose what I’ve made?” or “Every-one’s going to
                    want what I have” or “I’m going to get creamed in taxes.” In
                    short, until we get to the root of this issue and dissolve the
                    fear, no amount of money will help.<br><br>
                    Of course, given a choice, most of us would rather worry
                    about having money and losing it than not having money at all,
                    but neither are overly enlightened ways to live.<br><br>
                    As with those of us driven by fear, many people are motivated to achieve financial success to prove
                    they are “good
                    enough.” We’ll cover this challenge in detail in Part II of this
                    book, but for now, just realize that no amount of money can
                    ever make you good enough. Money can’t make you something you already are. Again, as with fear, the
                    “always having
                    to prove yourself ” issue becomes your habitual way of living.<br><br>
                    You don’t even recognize it’s running you. You call your-
                    self a high achiever, a hard driver, determined, and all these
                    traits are fine. The only question is why? What is the root
                    engine that drives all this?<br><br>
                    For people who are driven to prove they are good enough,
                    no amount of money can ease the pain of that inner wound
                    that makes everything and everyone in their life “not enough.”<br><br>
                    No amount of money, or anything else for that matter, will
                    ever be enough for people who feel they are not good enough
                    themselves.<br><br>
                    Again, it’s all about you. Remember, your inner world reflects your outer world. If you believe you
                    are not enough, you
                    will validate that belief and create the reality that you don’t
                    have enough. On the other hand, if you believe you are plenty,
                    you will validate that belief and create plenty of abundance.
                    Why? Because “plenty” will be your root, which will then
                    become your natural way of being.<br><br>
                    By unlinking your money motivation from anger, fear, and
                    the need to prove yourself, you can install new links for
                    earning your money through purpose, contribution, and joy. That
                    way, you’ll never have to get rid of your money to be happy.<br><br>
                    Being a rebel or the opposite of your parents is not always a
                    problem. To the contrary, if you were a rebel (often the case
                    with second-born children) and your folks had poor money
                    habits, it’s probably a good thing that you are their opposite.<br><br>
                    On the other hand, if your parents were successful and you’re
                    rebelling against them, you could be in for serious financial
                    difficulties.<br><br>
                    Either way, what’s important is to recognize how your way
                    of being relates to one or both of your parents in the arena of
                    money.<br><br>

                    AWARENESS: Consider the ways of being and habits each

                <h2>The Third Influence: Specific Incidents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The third primary way in which we are conditioned is by
                    specific incidents. What did you experience when you were
                    young around money, wealth, and rich people? These experiences are extremely important because they
                    shape the
                    beliefs—or rather, the illusions—you now live by.<br><br>
                    Let me give you an example. A woman who was an
                    operating-room nurse attended the Millionaire Mind Intensive
                    Seminar. Josey had an excellent income, but somehow she
                    always spent all of her money. When we dug a little deeper,
                    she revealed that when she was eleven years old, she
                    remembers being at a Chinese restaurant with her parents and
                    her sister. Her mom and dad were having yet another bitter
                    argument about money. Her dad was standing up, screaming
                    and slamming his fist on the table. She remembers him turning
                    red, then blue, then falling to the floor from a heart attack. She
                    was on the swim team at school and had CPR training, which
                    she administered, but to no avail. Her father died in her arms.<br><br>
                    And so, from that day forth, Josey’s mind linked money
                    with pain. It’s no wonder then that as an adult, she subconsciously got rid of all of her money in
                    an effort to get rid of
                    her pain. It’s also interesting to note that she became a nurse.<br><br>
                    Why? Is it possible that she was still trying to save her dad?
                    At the course, we helped Josey identify her old money
                    blueprint and revise it. Today she’s well on her way to becoming financially free. She’s also not a
                    nurse anymore. Not
                    that she didn’t enjoy her job. It’s just that she was in the
                    nursing profession for the wrong reason. She’s now a financial
                    planner, still helping people, but this time one-on-one, to
                    understand how their past programming runs every aspect of
                    their financial lives.<br><br>
                    Let me give you another example of a specific incident, one
                    that’s closer to home. When my wife was eight years old, she
                    would hear the clanging bells of the ice cream truck coming
                    down the street. She would run to her mom and ask for a
                    quarter. Her mom would reply, “Sorry, dear, I don’t have any
                    money. Go ask Dad. Dad’s got all the money.” My wife would
                    then go ask her dad. He’d give her a quarter, she’d go get her
                    ice cream cone, and she was a happy camper.<br><br>
                    Week after week, the same incident would repeat itself. So
                    what did my wife learn about money?<br><br>
                    First, that men have all the money. So once we got married,
                    what do you think she expected of me? That’s right: money.
                    And I’ll tell you what, she wasn’t asking for quarters anymore!
                    Somehow she’d graduated.<br><br>
                    Second, she learned that women don’t have money. If her
                    mom (the deity) didn’t have money, obviously this is the way
                    she should be. To validate that way of being, she would subconsciously get rid of all her money. She
                    was quite precise
                    about it too. If you gave her $100, she’d spend $100. If you
                    gave her $200, she’d spend $200. If you gave her $500, she’d
                    spend $500, and if you gave her $1,000, she’d spend $1,000.<br><br>
                    Then she took one of my courses and learned all about the art
                    of leverage. I gave her $2,000, she spent $10,000! I tried to
                    explain, “No, honey, leverage means we’re the ones who are
                    supposed to get the ten thousand dollars, not spend it.”
                    Somehow it just wasn’t sinking in.<br><br>
                    The only thing we ever fought about was money. It almost
                    cost us our marriage. What we didn’t know at the time was
                    that the meanings each of us attributed to money were
                    radically different. To my wife, money meant immediate
                    pleasure (as in enjoying her ice cream). I, on the other hand,
                    grew up with the belief that money was meant to be accumulated as the means to create freedom.<br><br>
                    As far as I was concerned, whenever my wife spent money,
                    she wasn’t spending money, she was spending our future
                    freedom. And as far as she was concerned, whenever I held
                    her back from spending, I was taking away her pleasure in life.<br><br>
                    Thank goodness we learned how to revise each of our
                    money blueprints and, more importantly, create a third money
                    blueprint specifically for the relationship.<br><br>
                    
                    Success Story from Deborah Chamitoff
                    From: Deborah Chamitoff
                    To: T. Harv Eker Subject: Financially free!
                    Harv,
                    Today, I have 18 sources of passive income and I no
                    longer need a J.O.B. Yes, I am rich, but more importantly,
                    my life is enriched, joyful, and abundant! But it wasn’t
                    always this way.<br><br>
                    Money used to be a burden to me. I trusted strangers to
                    manage my financial affairs just so I wouldn’t have to deal
                    with it. I lost almost everything during the last stock market
                    crash, and I didn’t even realize it until it was too late.
                    More importantly, I lost my self-respect. Paralyzed with
                    fear, shame, and hopelessness, I withdrew from everyone
                    and everything around me. I continued to punish myself
                    right up until I was dragged to the Millionaire Mind.<br><br>
                    During that transformational weekend, I reclaimed my
                    power and resolved to take control of my own financial
                    destiny. I embraced the Declarations of Wealth and forgave
                    myself for past mistakes, truly believing that I deserved to
                    be wealthy.<br><br>
                    And now, I’m actually having fun managing my own
                    money! I am financially free and know I always will be
                    because I have a Millionaire Mind!
                    Thank you, Harv . . . thank you.<br><br>
                    Does all this work? Let me put it this way; I’ve witnessed
                    three miracles in my life:
                    1. The birth of my daughter.
                    2. The birth of my son.
                    3. My wife and I not fighting about money anymore!
                    Statistics show that the number one cause of all relationship
                    breakups is money. The biggest reason behind the fights
                    people have about money is not the money itself, but the
                    mismatch of their “blueprints.” It doesn’t matter how much
                    money you have or don’t have. If your blueprint doesn’t match
                    that of the person you’re dealing with, you’ll have a major
                    challenge. This goes for married couples, dating couples,
                    family relationships, and even business associates. The key is
                    to comprehend that you are dealing with blueprints, not
                    money. Once you recognize a person’s money blueprint, you
                    can deal with your partner in a way that works for both of you.
                    You can begin by becoming aware that your partner’s money
                    files are probably not the same as yours. Instead of getting
                    upset, choose understanding. Do your best to find out what’s
                    important to your partner in the arena of money and identify
                    his or her motivations and fears. In this way, you’ll be dealing
                    with the roots instead of the fruits and have a good shot of
                    making it work. Otherwise, no way, Jose!
                    One of the most important things you will learn, should you
                    decide to attend the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, is
                    how to recognize your partner’s money blueprint as well as
                    how to create a brand-new blueprint between both of you that
                    helps you as partners get what you really want. It is truly a
                    blessing to be able to do this, as it alleviates one of the biggest
                    causes of pain for most people.<br><br>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here’s an exercise you can do with your partner. Sit down and
                    discuss the history each of you brings to your thoughts about
                    money—what you heard when you were young, what was
                    modeled in your family, and any emotional incidents that
                    occurred. Also, find out what money really means to your
                    partner. Is it pleasure or freedom or security or status? This
                    will assist you in identifying each other’s current money
                    blueprint and may help you discover why you might be disagreeing in this arena.
                    Next, discuss what you want today not as individuals, but as
                    a partnership. Decide and agree upon your general goals and
                    attitudes with regard to money and success. Then create a list
                    of these attitudes and actions you both agree to live by and
                    write them down. Post them on the wall, and if ever there’s an
                    issue, gently, very gently, remind each other what you decided
                    together when you were both objective, unemotional, and
                    outside the grip of your old money blueprints.<br><br>
                    AWARENESS: Consider a specific emotional incident you
                    experienced around money when you were young.
                    UNDERSTANDING: Write down how this incident may
                    have affected your current financial life.<br><br>
                    DISASSOCIATION: Can you see this way of being is only
                    what you learned and isn’t you? Can you see you have a
                    choice in the present moment to be different?
                    DECLARATION: Place your hand on your heart and say...<br><br>
                    “I release my nonsupportive money experiences from
                    the past and create a new and rich future.”
                    Touch your head and say...<br><br>
                    “I have a millionaire mind!”

            <!--So What Is Your Money Blueprint Set For?-->
            <article id="article-12" class="bg-article p-5 mt-3">
                <h2>So What Is Your Money Blueprint Set For?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now, it’s time to answer the “million dollar” question. What is
                    your current money and success blueprint, and what results is
                    it subconsciously moving you toward? Are you set for success,
                    mediocrity, or financial failure? Are you programmed for
                    struggle or for ease around money? Are you set for working
                    hard for your money or working in balance?<br><br>
                    Are you conditioned for having a consistent income or an
                    inconsistent income? You know the scoop: “First you have it,
                    then you don’t, then you have it, then you don’t.” It always
                    appears as though the reasons for these drastic fluctuations
                    come from the outside world. For instance: “I got a greatpaying job but then the company folded.
                    Then I started my
                    own business and things were booming, but the market dried
                    up. My next business was doing super, but then my partner
                    left, et cetera.” Don’t be fooled, this is your blueprint at work.<br><br>
                    Are you set for having a high income, a moderate income,
                    or a low income? Did you know there are actual dollar
                    amounts for which many of us are programmed? Are you set
                    for earning $20,000 to $30,000 a year? $40,000 to $60,000?
                    $75,000 to $100,000? $150,000 to $200,000? $250,000 a year or
                    more?<br><br>
                    A few years ago, I had an unusually well-dressed gentleman
                    in the audience during one of my two-hour evening
                    seminars. When the seminar was complete, he came over and
                    asked if I thought the three-day Millionaire Mind course could
                    do anything for him, considering he was already earning
                    $500,000 a year. I asked him how long he’d earned that kind of
                    money. He responded, “Consistently, for about seven years
                    now.”<br><br>
                    That was all I needed to hear. I asked him why he wasn’t
                    earning $2 million a year. I told him that the program was for
                    people who want to reach their full financial potential and asked
                    him to consider why he was “stuck” at half a million. He
                    decided to come to the program.<br><br>
                    I got an e-mail from him a year later that said, “The program was incredible but I made a mistake. I
                    only reset my
                    money blueprint to earn the $2 million a year as we discussed.
                    I’m already there, so I’m attending the course again to reset it
                    for earning $10 million a year.”<br><br>
                    The point I want to make is that the actual amounts don’t
                    matter. What matters is whether you are reaching your full
                    financial potential. I know many of you might be asking, why
                    on earth would anyone need that kind of money? First, that
                    very question is not overly supportive to your wealth and is a
                    sure sign you’ll want to revise your money blueprint. Second,
                    the main reason this gentleman wanted to earn massive
                    amounts of money was to support his work as a huge donor to
                    a charity that assists AIDS victims in Africa. So much for the
                    belief that rich people are “greedy”!<br><br>
                    Let’s go on. Are you programmed for saving money or for
                    spending money? Are you programmed for managing your
                    money well or mismanaging it?<br><br>
                    Are you set for picking winning investments or picking
                    losers? You might wonder, “How could whether or not I make
                    money in the stock market or in real estate be part of
                    my blueprint?” Simple. Who picks the stock or the property?
                    You do. Who picks when you buy it? You do. Who picks
                    when you sell it? You do. I guess you’ve got something to do
                    with the equation.<br><br>
                    I have an acquaintance in San Diego named Larry. Larry is a
                    magnet when it comes to making money: he definitely has a
                    high income blueprint. But he has the kiss of death when it
                    comes to investing his money. Whatever he buys drops like a
                    rock. (Would you believe his dad had the exact same problem?
                    Duh!) I keep in close touch with Larry so I can ask him for
                    investment advice. It is always perfect... perfectly wrong!
                    Whatever Larry suggests, I go the other way. I love Larry!<br><br>
                    On the other hand, notice how other people seem to have
                    what we termed earlier the Midas touch. Everything they get
                    involved with turns to gold. Both the Midas-touch and the
                    kiss-of-death syndromes are nothing more than the manifestations of money blueprints.<br><br>
                    Once again, your money blueprint will determine your financial life—and even your personal life. If
                    you are a woman
                    whose money blueprint is set for low, chances are you will
                    attract a man who is also set for low so you can stay in your
                    financial “comfort zone” and validate your blueprint. If you
                    are a man who is set for low, chances are you will attract a
                    woman who is a spender and gets rid of all your money, so
                    you can stay in your financial “comfort zone” and validate
                    your blueprint.<br><br>
                    Most people believe the success of their business is primarily dependent on their business skills
                    and knowledge or at
                    least their timing of the marketplace. I hate to be the one to
                    break it to you, but that’s la-la land, which is another way of
                    saying, not a chance!<br><br>
                    How well your business does is a result of your money
                    blueprint. You will always validate your blueprint. If you have
                    a blueprint that is set for earning $100,000 a year, that’s exactly
                    how well the business will do, enough to earn you about
                    $100,000 a year.<br><br>
                    If you are a salesperson and your blueprint is set for earning
                    $50,000 a year and somehow you make a huge sale that makes
                    you $90,000 that year, either the sale will cancel or if you do
                    end up with $90,000, get ready for a crummy year to follow to
                    make up for it and bring you back to the level of your financial
                    blueprint.<br><br>
                    On the other hand, if you’re set for earning $50,000 and
                    you’ve been in a slump for a couple of years, don’t worry,
                    you’ll get it all back. You have to, it’s the subconscious law of
                    the mind and money. Someone in this position would probably walk across the street, get hit by a
                    bus, and end up with
                    exactly $50,000 a year in insurance! It’s simple: one way or
                    another, if you’re set for $50,000 a year, eventually that’s what
                    you’ll get.<br><br>
                    So again, how can you tell what your money blueprint is set
                    for? One of the most obvious ways is to look at your results.
                    Look at your bank account. Look at your income. Look at
                    your net worth. Look at your success with investments. Look
                    at your business success. Look at whether you’re a spender or
                    a saver. Look at whether you manage money well. Look at
                    how consistent or inconsistent you are. Look at how hard you
                    work for your money. Look at your relationships that involve
                    money.<br><br>
                    Is money a struggle or does it come to you easily? Do you
                    own a business or do you have a job? Do you stick with one
                    business or job for a long time or do you jump around a lot?
                    Your blueprint is like a thermostat. If the temperature in
                    the room is seventy-two degrees, chances are good that the
                    thermostat is set for seventy-two degrees. Now here’s where it
                    gets interesting. Is it possible that because the window is open
                    and it is cold outside, the temperature in the room can drop to
                    sixty-five degrees? Of course, but what will eventually happen?
                    The thermostat will kick in and bring the temperature back to
                    seventy-two.<br><br>
                    Also, is it possible that because the window is open and it’s
                    hot outside, the temperature in the room can go up to seventyseven degrees? Sure it could, but what
                    will eventually happen?
                    The thermostat will kick in and bring the temperature back to
                    seventy-two.<br><br>
                    The only way to permanently change the temperature in the
                    room is to reset the thermostat. In the same way, the only way
                    to change your level of financial success “permanently” is to
                    reset your financial thermostat, otherwise known as your
                    money blueprint.<br><br>

                    You can try anything and everything else you want. You can
                    develop your knowledge in business, in marketing, in sales, in
                    negotiations, and in management. You can become an expert
                    in real estate or the stock market. All of these are tremendous
                    “tools.” But in the end, without an inner “tool-
                    box” that is big enough and strong enough for you to create
                    and hold on to large amounts of money, all the tools in the
                    world will be useless to you.<br><br>
                    Once again, it’s simple arithmetic: “Your income can grow
                    only to the extent that you do.”<br><br>
                    Fortunately or unfortunately, your personal money and
                    success blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your
                    life—unless you identify and change it. And that is exactly
                    what we will continue to do in Part II of this book and do
                    even further with you at the Millionaire Mind Intensive
                    Seminar.<br><br>
                    Remember that the first element of all change is awareness.
                    Watch yourself, become conscious, observe your thoughts,
                    your fears, your beliefs, your habits, your actions, and even
                    your inactions. Put yourself under a microscope. Study
                    yourself.<br><br>
                    Most of us believe that we live our lives based on choice. Not
                    usually! Even if we’re really enlightened, we might make just a
                    few choices during the average day that reflect our awareness
                    of ourselves in the present moment. But for the most part,
                    we’re like robots, running on automatic, ruled by our past
                    conditioning and old habits. That’s where consciousness
                    comes in. Consciousness is observing your thoughts and
                    actions so that you can live from true choice in the present
                    moment rather than being run by programming from the past.<br><br>

                    <h6>Consciousness is observing your thoughts and
                    actions so that you can live from true choice in the

                    By achieving consciousness, we can live from who we are
                    today rather than who we were yesterday. In this way, we can
                    respond appropriately to situations, tapping the full range and
                    potential of our skills and talents, rather than inappropriately
                    reacting to events, driven by the fears and insecurities of the
                    past.<br><br>
                    Once you are conscious, you can see your programming for
                    what it is: simply a recording of information you received and
                    believed in the past, when you were too young to know any
                    better. You can see that this conditioning is not who you are
                    but who you learned to be. You can see that you are not the
                    “recording” but the “recorder.” You are not the “content” in
                    the glass but the “glass” itself. You are not the software but
                    the hardware.<br><br>
                    Yes, genetics may play a role, and, yes, spiritual aspects may
                    come into play, but much of what shapes who you are comes
                    from other people’s beliefs and information. As I suggested
                    earlier, beliefs are not necessarily true or false or right or
                    wrong, but regardless of their validity, beliefs are opinions that
                    are passed around and around and then down from generation
                    to generation to you. Knowing this, you can consciously
                    choose to release any belief or way of being that is not
                    supportive to your wealth, and you can replace it with one that
                    is.<br><br>
                    In our courses we teach that “no thought lives in your head
                    rent-free.” Each thought you have will either be an investment
                    or a cost. It will either move you toward happiness and success
                    or away from it. It will either empower you or disempower
                    you. That’s why it is imperative you choose your thoughts and
                    beliefs wisely.<br><br>
                    Realize that your thoughts and beliefs aren’t who you are,
                    and they are not necessarily attached to you. As precious as
                    you believe them to be, they have no more importance and
                    meaning than you give them. Nothing has meaning except for the
                    meaning you give it.<br><br>
                    Recall how at the beginning of this book I suggested you
                    don’t believe a word I say? Well, if you really want to take off
                    in your life, don’t believe a word you say. And if you want instant enlightenment, don’t believe a
                    thought you think.
                    Meanwhile, if you’re like most people, you’re going to believe something, so you might as well adopt
                    beliefs that support you, rich beliefs. Remember, thoughts lead to feelings,
                    which lead to actions, which lead to results. You can choose to
                    think and act like rich people do and therefore create the
                    results that rich people create.<br><br>
                    The question is, “How do rich people think and act?”
                    That’s exactly what you’ll discover in Part II of this book.<br><br>

                    “I observe my thoughts and entertain only those that

                    “I have a millionaire mind!”<br><br>
                    Success Story from Rhonda & Bob Baines
                    From: Rhonda & Bob Baines To: T. Harv Eker Subject: We feel
                    free!
                    We went to the Millionaire Mind Intensive not really knowing
                    what to expect. We were very impressed with the results. Before
                    attending the seminar, we were having a lot of money problems.
                    We never seemed to get ahead. We would continually be in debt
                    and not know why. We would pay off our credit cards (usually from
                    a large bonus at work), only to get back into debt within six
                    months. It did not matter how much money we made. We were
                    very frustrated and argued a lot.<br><br>
                    Then we attended Millionaire Mind. While listening to Harv, my
                    husband and I kept squeezing each other’s leg and smiling and
                    looking at each other. We heard so much information that had us
                    saying, “No wonder,” “Oh, so that’s why,” “Everything makes
                    sense now.” We were very excited.<br><br>
                    We learned how he and I think so differently when it comes to
                    money. How he is a “spender” and how I am an “avoider.” What a
                    horrible combination! After hearing the information, we stopped
                    blaming each other and started understanding each other and
                    ultimately started to appreciate and love each other more.
                    It is almost a year later and we still do not argue about money—
                    we just talk about what we learned. We are no longer in debt; in
                    fact we have money in savings, the first time in our 16-year
                    relationship—yeah! We now not only have money for our future,
                    but we also have enough money for our normal everyday
                    expenses, playing, education, long-term savings for a home, and
                    we even have money to share and give away. It feels wonderful
                    knowing that we can use money in those areas and not feel guilty
                    because we allocated and dedicated it for that purpose.
                    We feel free.<br><br>
                    Thank you very much, Harv.
