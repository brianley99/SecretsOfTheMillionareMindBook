                <p>
                    N PART I OF THIS BOOK WE DISCUSSED THE PROCESS
                    of Manifestation. Recall that thoughts lead to feelings, feelings
                    lead to actions, and actions lead to results. Everything begins
                    with your thoughts—which are produced by your mind. Isn’t
                    it amazing that our mind is pretty much the basis for our life
                    and yet most of us have no clue as to how this powerful
                    apparatus functions? So let’s start by taking a simple look at
                    how your mind works. Metaphorically, your mind is nothing
                    more than a big file cabinet, similar to what you’d find in your
                    office or home. All information that comes in is labeled and
                    filed in folders so that it’s easy to retrieve to help you survive.
                    Did you hear that? I didn’t say thrive, I said survive.<br><br>
                    In every situation, you go to the files of your mind to determine how to respond. Say, for
                    example, you’re considering
                    a financial opportunity. You automatically go to your file
                    labeled money and from there decide what to do. The only
                    thoughts you can have about money will be what are stored
                    in your money file. That’s all you can think about, because
                    that’s all that is in your mind under that category.<br><br>
                    You decide based on what you believe is logical, sensible,
                    and appropriate for you at the time. You make what you think
                    is the right choice. The problem, however, is that your right
                    choice may not be a successful choice. In fact, what makes
                    perfect sense to you may consistently produce perfectly poor
                    results.<br><br>
                    For instance, let’s say my wife is in the mall. That shouldn’t
                    be too hard for me to imagine. She sees this green purse. It’s
                    on sale for 25 percent off. She immediately goes to her mind
                    files with the question “Should I get this purse?” In a
                    nanosecond, her mind files come back with the answer:
                    “You’ve been looking for a green purse to go with those green
                    shoes you bought last week. Plus it’s just the right size. Buy it!”
                    As she rushes to the checkout counter, her mind is not only
                    thrilled that she’s going to have this beautiful purse, but
                    glowing with pride that she got it for 25 percent off.<br><br>
                    To her mind, this purchase makes perfect sense. She wants
                    it, she believes she needs it, and it is “such a deal.” However,
                    at no point did her mind come up with the thought “True, this
                    is a really nice purse, and true, this is a great deal, but right
                    now I’m three thousand dollars in debt, so I’d better hold off.”
                    She didn’t come up with that information because no file in
                    her head contains that. The file of “When you’re in debt, don’t
                    buy any more” was never installed in her and doesn’t exist,
                    which means that particular choice is not an option.<br><br>
                    Do you catch my drift? If you’ve got files in your cabinet
                    that are nonsupportive to financial success, those will be the
                    only choices you can make. They’ll be natural, automatic,
                    and make perfect sense to you. But in the end, they will still
                    produce financial failure or mediocrity at best. Conversely, if
                    you’ve got mind files that support financial success, you will
                    naturally and automatically make decisions that produce
                    success. You won’t have to think about it. Your normal way of
                    thinking will result in success, kind of like Donald Trump. His
                    normal way of thinking produces wealth.<br><br>
                    When it comes to money, wouldn’t it be incredible if you
                    could inherently think how rich people think? I sure hope you
                    said “absolutely” or something to that effect.<br><br>
                    Well, you can!<br>
                    As we stated previously, the first step to any change is
                    awareness, meaning the first step to thinking the way rich
                    people think is to know how rich people think.<br><br>
                    Rich people think very differently from poor and middleclass people. They think differently
                    about money, wealth,
                    themselves, other people, and pretty well every other facet of
                    life. In Part II of this book, we’re going to examine some of
                    these differences and, as part of your reconditioning, install
                    seventeen alternative “wealth files” into your mind. With new
                    files come new choices. You can then catch yourself when you
                    are thinking like poor and middle-class people and consciously
                    shift your focus to how rich people think. Remember, you can
                    choose to think in ways that will support you in your happiness
                    and success instead of ways that don’t.

                        support you in your happiness and success
                        instead of ways that don’t.</h5>
                </div>
                <p>
                    A few caveats to begin. First, in no way, shape, or form do I
                    mean to degrade poor people or want to appear to be without
                    compassion for their situation. I do not believe that rich
                    people are better than poor people. They’re just richer. At the
                    same time, I want to make sure you get the message, so I’m
                    going to make the distinctions between the rich and poor as
                    extreme as possible.<br><br>
                    Second, when I discuss rich, poor, and middle-class people,
                    what I am referring to is their mentality—how different folks
                    think and act rather than the actual amount of money they’ve
                    got or their value to society.<br><br>
                    Third, I will be generalizing “big time.” I understand that
                    not all rich and not all poor people are the way I’m describing
                    them to be. Again, my objective is to make sure you get the
                    point of each principle and use it.<br><br>
                    Fourth, for the most part, I will not always be referring to
                    the middle class specifically, because middle-class people
                    usually have a mix of rich and poor mentalities. Again, my goal
                    is for you to become aware of where you fit on the scale and
                    to think more like the rich if you want to create more wealth.
                    Fifth, several of the principles in this section may appear to
                    deal more with habits and actions than with ways of thinking.
                    Remember, our actions come from our feelings, which come
                    from our thoughts. Consequently, every rich action is preceded
                    by a rich way of thinking.<br><br>
                    Finally, I’m going to ask you to be willing to let go of being
                    right ! What I mean by that is, be willing to let go of having to
                    do it your way. Why? Because your way has gotten you exactly
                    what you’ve got right now. If you want more of the same, keep
                    doing it your way. If you’re not yet rich, however, maybe it’s
                    time you consider a different way, especially
                    one that comes from someone who is really, really rich and has
                    put thousands of others on the road to wealth too. It’s up to
                    you.<br><br>
                    The concepts you are about to learn are simple but profound. They make real changes for real
                    people in the real
                    world. How do I know? At my company, Peak Potentials
                    Training, we get thousands of letters and e-mails each year
                    telling us how each individual wealth file has transformed
                    people’s lives. If you learn them and use them, I am confident
                    they will transform your life too.<br><br>
                    At the end of each section you will find a declaration and a
                    physical movement with which to “anchor” it into your body.
                    You will also find actions to take to support you in adopting
                    this wealth file. It is imperative you put each file into action in
                    your life as quickly as possible so that the knowledge can move
                    to a physical, cellular level and create lasting and permanent
                    change.<br><br>
                    Most people understand we are creatures of habit, but what
                    they don’t realize is that there are actually two kinds of habits:
                    doing habits and not-doing habits. Everything you are not doing
                    right now, you are in the habit of not doing. The only way to
                    change these not-doing habits into doing habits is to do them.
                    Reading will assist you, but it’s a whole different world when
                    you go from reading to doing. If you are truly serious about
                    success, prove it, and do the actions suggested.<br><br>

            <article id="article-01" class="p-3 bg-article mt-3">
                <h2 id="chapter" class="text-center">Wealth File #1</h2>
                <h3 class="text-center">Rich people believe “I create my life.”</h3>
                <h3 class="text-center">Poor people believe “Life happens to me.”</h3>
                <p><br>
                    If you want to create wealth, it is imperative that you believe
                    that you are at the steering wheel of your life, especially your
                    financial life. If you don’t believe this, then you must inherently believe that you have little or
                    no control over your life,
                    and therefore you have little or no control over your financial
                    success. That is not a rich attitude.<br><br>
                    Did you ever notice that it’s usually poor people who spend
                    a fortune playing the lottery? They actually believe their wealth
                    is going to come from someone picking their name out of a
                    hat. They spend Saturday night glued to the TV, excitedly
                    watching the draw, to see if wealth is going to “land” on them
                    this week.<br><br>
                    Sure, everyone wants to win the lottery, and even rich
                    people play for fun once in a while. But first, they don’t spend
                    half their paycheck on tickets, and second, winning the lotto is
                    not their primary “strategy” for creating wealth.<br><br>
                    You have to believe that you are the one who creates your
                    success, that you are the one who creates your mediocrity, and
                    that you are the one creating your struggle around money and
                    success. Consciously or unconsciously, it’s still you.<br><br>
                    Instead of taking responsibility for what’s going on in their
                    lives, poor people choose to play the role of the victim. A
                    victim’s predominant thought is often “poor me.” So presto,
                    by virtue of the law of intention, that’s literally what victims
                    get: they get to be “poor.”<br><br>
                    Notice that I said they play the role of victim. I didn’t say
                    they are victims. I don’t believe anyone is a victim. I believe
                    people play the victim because they think it gets them something. We’ll discuss this in more detail
                    shortly.<br><br>
                    That said, how can you tell when people are playing the
                    victim? They leave three obvious clues.<br><br>
                    Now, before we talk about these clues, I want you to realize
                    that I fully understand that none of these ways of being has
                    anything to do with anyone reading this book. But maybe, just
                    maybe, you might know someone who can relate. And maybe,
                    just maybe, you might know that person intimately! Either
                    way, I suggest you pay close attention to this section.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Victim Clue #1: Blame</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to why they’re not rich, most victims are
                    professionals at the “blame game.” The object of this game is
                    to see how many people and circumstances you can point the
                    finger at without ever looking at yourself. It’s fun for victims
                    at least. Unfortunately it’s not such a blast for anyone else who
                    is unlucky enough to be around them. That’s because those in
                    close proximity to victims become easy targets.<br><br>
                    Victims blame the economy, they blame the government,
                    they blame the stock market, they blame their broker, they
                    blame their type of business, they blame their employer, they
                    blame their employees, they blame their manager, they blame
                    the head office, they blame their up-line or their down-line,
                    they blame customer service, they blame the shipping
                    department, they blame their partner, they blame their spouse,
                    they blame God, and of course they always blame their
                    parents. It’s always someone else or something else that is to
                    blame. The problem is anything or anyone but them.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Victim Clue #2: Justifying</h3>
                <p>
                    If victims aren’t blaming, you’ll often find them justifying or
                    rationalizing their situation by saying something like “Money’s
                    not really important.” Let me ask you this question: If you said
                    that your husband or your wife, or your boyfriend or your
                    girlfriend, or your partner or your friend, weren’t all that
                    important, would any of them be around for long? I don’t
                    think so, and neither would money!<br><br>
                    At my live seminars, some participants always come up to
                    me and say, “You know, Harv, money’s not really that important.” I look them directly in the eyes
                    and say, “You’re
                    broke! Right?” They usually look down at their feet and
                    meekly reply with something like “Well, right now I’m having
                    a few financial challenges, but . . .” I interrupt, “No, it’s not
                    just right now, it’s always; you’ve always been broke or close to
                    it, yes or yes?” At this point they usually nod their head in
                    agreement and woefully return to their seats, ready to listen
                    and learn, as they finally realize what a disastrous effect this
                    one belief has had on their lives.<br><br>
                    Of course they’re broke. Would you have a motorcycle if it
                    wasn’t important to you? Of course not. Would you have a pet
                    parrot if it wasn’t important to you? Of course not. In the
                    same way, if you don’t think money is important, you simply
                    won’t have any.<br><br>
                    You can actually dazzle your friends with this insight.
                    Imagine you’re in a conversation with a friend who tells you,
                    “Money’s not important.” Put your hand on your forehead
                    and look up as though you are getting a message from the
                    heavens, then exclaim, “You’re broke!” To which your
                    shocked friend will undoubtedly respond, “How did you
                    know?” Then you stretch out your palm and you reply,
                    “What else do you want to know? That’ll be fifty bucks,
                    please!”<br><br>
                    Let me put it bluntly: anyone who says money isn’t important doesn’t have any! Rich people
                    understand the importance of money and the place it has in our society. On the
                    other hand, poor people validate their financial ineptitude by
                    using irrelevant comparisons. They’ll argue, “Well, money isn’t
                    as important as love.” Now, is that comparison dumb or what?
                    What’s more important, your arm or your leg? Maybe they’re
                    both important.<br><br>
                    Listen up, my friends: Money is extremely important in the
                    areas in which it works, and extremely unimportant in the
                    areas in which it doesn’t. And although love may make the
                    world go round, it sure doesn’t pay for the building of any
                    hospitals, churches, or homes. It also doesn’t feed anybody.<br>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Not convinced? Try paying your bills with love. Still not
                    sure? Then pop on over to the bank and try depositing some
                    love and see what happens. I’ll save you the trouble. The teller
                    will look at you as if you’ve just gone AWOL from the loony
                    bin and scream only one word: “Security!”<br><br>
                    No rich people believe money is not important. And if I’ve
                    failed to persuade you and you still somehow believe that
                    money’s not important, then I have only two words for you,
                    you’re broke, and you always will be until you eradicate that
                    nonsupportive file from your financial blueprint.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Victim Clue #3: Complaining</h3>
                <p>
                    Complaining is the absolute worst possible thing you could do
                    for your health or your wealth. The worst! Why?<br><br>
                    I’m a big believer in the universal law that states, “What you
                    focus on expands.” When you are complaining, what are you
                    focusing on, what’s right with your life or what’s wrong with
                    it? You are obviously focusing on what’s wrong with it, and
                    since what you focus on expands, you’ll keep getting more of
                    what’s wrong.<br><br>
                    Many teachers in the personal development field talk about
                    the Law of Attraction. It states that “like attracts like,”
                    meaning that when you are complaining, you are actually attracting “crap” into your life.<br>
                </p>
                <div class="wealth-principle mb-3">
                    <a href="./wealthPrincibles.html">
                        <h6>WEALTH PRINCIPLE</h6>
                    </a>
                    <h5>When you are complaining, you become a living,
                        breathing “crap magnet.”</h5>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Have you ever noticed that complainers usually have a
                    tough life? It seems that everything that could go wrong does
                    go wrong for them. They say, “Of course I complain— look
                    how crappy my life is.” And now that you know better, you
                    can explain to them, “No, it’s because you complain that your
                    life is so crappy. Shut up... and don’t stand near me!”<br><br>
                    Which brings us to another point. You have to make darn
                    sure not to put yourself in the proximity of complainers. If you
                    absolutely have to be nearby, make sure you bring a steel
                    umbrella or the crap meant for them will get you too!<br><br>
                    I stay as far away from complainers as possible because
                    negative energy is infectious. Plenty of people, however, love
                    to hang out and listen to complainers. Why? It’s simple: they’re
                    waiting for their turn! “You think that’s bad? Wait till you hear
                    what happened to me!”<br><br>
                    Here’s some homework that I promise will change your life.
                    For the next seven days, I challenge you to not complain at all.
                    Not just out loud, but in your head as well. But you have to do
                    it for the full seven days. Why? Because for the first few days,
                    you may still have some “residual crap” coming to you from
                    before. Unfortunately, crap doesn’t travel at the speed of light,
                    you know, it travels at the speed of crap, so it might take a
                    while to clear out.<br><br>
                    I’ve given this challenge to thousands of people, and I’m
                    blown away at how many of them have told me that this one,
                    teensy-weensy exercise has transformed their lives. I guarantee
                    you’ll be astonished at how amazing your life will be when you
                    stop focusing on—and thereby stop attracting—crap into your
                    life. If you’ve been a complainer, forget about attracting
                    success for now; for most people, just getting to “neutral”
                    would be a great start!<br><br>
                    Blame, justification, and complaining are like pills. They are
                    nothing more than stress reducers. They alleviate the stress of
                    failure. Think about it. If a person weren’t failing in some way,
                    shape, or form, would he or she need to blame, justify, or
                    complain? The obvious answer is no.
                    From now on, as you hear yourself disastrously blaming,
                    justifying, or complaining, cease and desist immediately. Remind yourself that you are creating your
                    life and that at every
                    moment you will be attracting either success or crap into your
                    life. It is imperative you choose your thoughts and words
                    wisely!<br><br>
                    Now you’re ready to hear one of the greatest secrets in the
                    world. Are you ready? Read this carefully: There is no such
                    60 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                    thing as a really rich victim! Did you get that? I’ll say it again:
                    There is no such thing as a really rich victim. Besides, who
                    would listen? “Tsk, tsk, I got a scratch in my yacht.” To which
                    almost anyone would respond, “Who gives a hoot?”<br>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, being a victim definitely has its rewards. What
                    do people get out of being a victim? The answer is attention. Is
                    attention important? You bet it is. In some form or another
                    it’s what almost everyone lives for. And the reason people live
                    for attention is that they’ve made a critical mistake. It is the
                    same error that virtually all of us have made. We’ve confused
                    attention with love.<br><br>
                    Believe me, it is virtually impossible to be truly happy and
                    successful when you’re constantly yearning for attention. Because if it’s attention you want, you’re
                    at the mercy of others.
                    You usually end up as a “people pleaser” begging for approval.
                    Attention-seeking is also a problem because people tend to do
                    stupid things to get it. It is imperative to “unhook” attention
                    and love, for a number of reasons.<br><br>
                    First, you will be more successful; second, you will be happier; and third, you can find “true” love
                    in your life. For the
                    most part, when people confuse love and attention, they don’t
                    love each other in the true spiritual sense of the word. They
                    love each other largely from the place of their own ego, as in
                    “I love what you do for me.” Therefore, the relationship is
                    really about the individual, and not about the other person or
                    at least the both of you.<br><br>
                    By disconnecting attention from love, you will be freed
                    up to love another for who they are, rather than what they do
                    for you.<br><br>
                    Now, as I said, there is no such thing as a rich victim. So to
                    stay a victim, attention seekers make darn sure they never get
                    rich.<br><br>
                    It’s time to decide. You can be a victim or you can be rich,
                    but you can’t be both. Listen up! Every time, and I mean every
                    time, you blame, justify, or complain, you are slitting your
                    financial throat. Sure, it would be nice to use a kinder and gentler
                    metaphor, but forget it. I’m not interested in kind or gentle
                    right now. I’m interested in helping you see exactly what the
                    heck you’re doing to yourself ! Later, once you get rich, we can
                    be kinder and gentler, how’s that?<br><br>
                    It’s time to take back your power and acknowledge that you
                    create everything that is in your life and everything that is not
                    in it. Realize that you create your wealth, your non-wealth, and
                    every level in between.<br>

                    1. Every time you catch yourself blaming, justifying, or
                    complaining, slide your index finger across your neck, as
                    a trigger to remind yourself that you are slitting your
                    financial throat. Once again, even though this gesture
                    may seem a little crude to do to yourself, it’s no more
                    crude than what you’re doing to yourself by blaming,
                    62 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                    justifying, or complaining, and it will eventually work
                    to alleviate these destructive habits.<br><br>
                    2. Do a “debrief.” At the end of each day, write down one
                    thing that went well and one thing that didn’t. Then write
                    the answer to the following question: “How did I create
                    each of these situations?” If others were involved, ask
                    yourself, “What was my part in creating each of these
                    situations?” This exercise will keep you accountable for
                    your life and make you aware of the strategies that are
                    working for you and the strategies that are not.

                <h2 class="text-center">Wealth File #2</h2>
                <h3 class="text-center">Rich people play the money game to win.</h3>
                <h3 class="text-center">Poor people play the money game to not lose.</h3>
                <p><br>
                    Poor people play the money game on defense rather than offense. Let me ask you: If you were to play
                    any sport or any
                    game strictly on defense, what are the chances of your winning
                    that game? Most people would agree, slim and none.<br><br>
                    Yet that’s exactly how most people play the money game.
                    Their primary concern is survival and security instead of
                    creating wealth and abundance. So, what is your goal? What is
                    your objective? What is your true intention?<br><br>
                    The goal of truly rich people is to have massive wealth and
                    abundance. Not just some money, but lots of money. So what
                    is the big goal of poor people? To “have enough to pay
                    the bills... and on time would be a miracle!” Again, let me
                    remind you of the power of intention. When your intention is
                    to have enough to pay the bills, that’s exactly how much you’ll
                    get—just enough to pay the bills and not a dime more.<br><br>
                    Middle-class people at least go a step further... too bad it’s a
                    tiny step. Their big goal in life also happens to be their favorite
                    word in the whole wide world. They just want to be
                    “comfortable.” I hate to break the news to you, but there’s a
                    huge difference between being comfortable and being rich.<br><br>
                    I have to admit, I didn’t always know that. But one of the
                    reasons I believe I have the right to even write this book is
                    that I’ve had the experience of being on all three sides of the
                    proverbial fence. I’ve been extremely broke, as in having to
                    borrow a dollar for gas for my car. But let me qualify that.
                    First, it wasn’t my car. Second, that dollar came in the form of
                    four quarters. Do you know how embarrassing it is for an
                    adult to pay for gas with four quarters? The kid at the pump
                    looked at me as if I were some kind of vending-machine robber and then just shook his head and
                    laughed. I don’t know if
                    you can relate, but it was definitely one of my financial low
                    points and unfortunately just one of them.<br><br>
                    Once I got my act together, I graduated to the level of being
                    comfortable. Comfortable is nice. At least you go out to decent
                    restaurants for a change. But pretty much all I could order was
                    chicken. Now, there’s nothing wrong with chicken, if that’s
                    what you really want. But often it’s not.<br><br>
                    In fact, people who are only financially comfortable usually
                    decide on what to eat by looking at the right-hand side of the
                    menu—the price side. “What would you like for dinner
                    tonight, dear?” “I’ll have this $7.95 dish. Let’s see what it is.
                    Surprise, surprise, it’s the chicken,” for the nineteenth time
                    this week!<br><br>
                    When you’re comfortable, you don’t dare allow your eyes to
                    look at the bottom of the menu, for if you did, you might
                    come across the most forbidden words in the middle-class
                    dictionary: market price! And even if you were curious, you’d
                    never ask what the price actually is. First, because you know
                    you can’t afford it. Second, it’s downright embarrassing when
                    you know the waiter doesn’t believe you when he tells you the
                    dish is $49 with side dishes extra and you say, “You know
                    what, for some reason, I have a real craving for chicken
                    tonight!”<br><br>
                    I have to say that for me personally, one of the best things
                    about being rich is not having to look at the prices on the
                    menu anymore. I eat exactly what I want to eat regardless of
                    the price. I can assure you, I didn’t do that when I was broke or
                    comfortable.<br><br>
                    It boils down to this: If your goal is to be comfortable,
                    chances are you’ll never get rich. But if your goal is to be rich,
                    chances are you’ll end up mighty comfortable.<br>

                    wonder why they’re not successful. Well, they just found out.
                    You get what you truly intend to get. If you want to get rich,
                    your goal has to be rich. Not to have enough to pay the bills,

                    1. Write down two financial objectives that demonstrate
                    your intention to create abundance, not mediocrity or
                    poverty. Write “play to win” goals for your:<br>
                    a. Annual income<br>
                    b. Net worth<br><br>
                    Make these goals achievable with a realistic time
                    frame, yet at the same time remember to “shoot for
                    the stars.”<br><br>
                    2. Go to an upscale restaurant and order a meal at “market
                    price” without asking how much it costs. (If funds are
                    tight, sharing is acceptable.)<br>

                <p><br>
                    Ask most people if they want to be rich and they’d look at you
                    as if you were crazy. “Of course I want to be rich,” they’d say.
                    The truth, however, is that most people don’t really want to be
                    rich. Why? Because they have a lot of negative wealth
                    files in their subconscious mind that tell them there is something wrong with being rich.<br><br>
                    At our Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, one of the
                    questions we ask people is “What are some of the possible
                    negatives about being rich or trying to get rich?”
                    Here’s what some people have to say. See if you can relate
                    to any of these.<br><br>
                    “What if I make it and lose it? Then I’ll really be a failure.”<br>
                    “I’ll never know if people like me for myself or for my
                    money.”<br>
                    “I’ll be at the highest tax bracket and have to give half my
                    money to the government.”<br>
                    “It’s too much work.”<br>
                    “I could lose my health trying.”<br>
                    “My friends and family will say, ‘Who do you think you
                    are?’ and criticize me.”<br>
                    “Everyone’s going to want a handout.”<br>
                    “I could be robbed.”<br>
                    “My kids could be kidnapped.”<br>
                    “It’s too much responsibility. I’ll have to manage all that
                    money. I’ll have to really understand investments. I’ll have to
                    worry about tax strategies and asset protection and have to
                    hire expensive accountants and lawyers. Yuck, what a hassle.”<br>
                    And on and on it goes....<br><br>
                    As I mentioned earlier, each of us has a wealth file inside
                    the cabinet called our mind. This file contains our personal
                    beliefs that include why being rich would be wonderful.
                    However, for many people, this file also includes information
                    as to why being rich might not be so wonderful. This means
                    they have mixed internal messages about wealth. One part of
                    them gleefully says, “Having more money will make
                    life a lot more fun.” But then another part screams, “Yeah, but
                    I’m going to have to work like a dog! What fun is that?” One
                    part says, “I’ll be able to travel the world.” Then the other part
                    chirps in, “Yeah, and everyone in the world will want a
                    handout.” These mixed messages may seem innocent enough,
                    but in reality, they are one of the major reasons most people
                    never become rich.<br><br>
                    You can look at it like this. The universe, which is another
                    way of saying “higher power,” is akin to a big mail-order department. It is constantly delivering
                    people, events, and things
                    to you. You “order” what you get by sending energetic
                    messages out to the universe based on your predominant beliefs. Again, based on the Law of
                    Attraction, the universe will
                    do its best to say yes and support you. But if you have mixed
                    messages in your file, the universe can’t understand what you
                    want.<br><br>
                    One minute the universe hears that you want to be rich, so
                    it begins sending you opportunities for wealth. But then it
                    hears you say, “Rich people are greedy,” so the universe begins
                    to support you in not having much money. But then you think,
                    “Having a lot of money makes life so much more enjoyable,”
                    so the poor universe, dazed and confused, restarts sending you
                    opportunities for more money. The next day you’re in an
                    uninspired mood so you think, “Money’s not that important.”
                    The frustrated universe finally screams, “Make up your frickin’
                    mind! I’ll get you what you want, just tell me what it is!”<br><br>
                    The number one reason most people don’t get what they want is that
                    they don’t know what they want. Rich people are totally clear that
                    they want wealth. They are unwavering in their desire. They
                    are fully committed to creating wealth. As long as it’s legal,
                    moral, and ethical, they will do whatever it takes
                    to have wealth. Rich people do not send mixed messages to
                    the universe. Poor people do.<br><br>
                    (By the way, when you read that last paragraph, if a little
                    voice inside your head said something to the effect of “Rich
                    people don’t care if it’s legal, moral, or ethical,” you are definitely doing the right thing in
                    reading this book. You’ll soon
                    find out what a detrimental way of thinking that is.<br>

                    Poor people have plenty of good reasons as to why getting
                    and actually being rich might be a problem. Consequently, they
                    are not 100 percent certain they really want to be rich. Their
                    message to the universe is confusing. Their message to others
                    is confusing. And why does all of this confusion happen?
                    Because their message to themselves is confusing.<br><br>
                    Earlier we talked about the power of intention. I know it
                    might be hard to believe, but you always get what you want—
                    what you subconsciously want, not what you say you want. You
                    might emphatically deny this and respond, “That’s crazy! Why
                    would I want to struggle?” And my question for you is exactly
                    the same: “I don’t know. Why would you want to struggle?”<br><br>
                    If you want to discover the reason, I invite you to attend the
                    Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, where you will identify
                    your money blueprint. The answer will be staring you in the
                    face. Put bluntly, if you are not achieving the wealth you say
                    you desire, there’s a good chance it’s because,
                    first, you subconsciously don’t really want wealth, or second,
                    you’re not willing to do what it takes to create it.<br><br>
                    Let’s explore this further. There are actually three levels of
                    so-called wanting. The first level is “I want to be rich.” That’s
                    another way of saying, “I’ll take it if it falls in my lap.” Wanting
                    alone is useless. Have you noticed that wanting doesn’t
                    necessarily lead to “having”? Notice also that wanting without
                    having leads to more wanting. Wanting becomes habitual and
                    leads only to itself, creating a perfect circle that goes exactly
                    nowhere. Wealth does not come from merely wanting it. How
                    do you know this is true? With a simple reality check: billions
                    of people want to be rich, relatively few are.<br><br>
                    The second level of wanting is “I choose to be rich.” This
                    entails deciding to become rich. Choosing is a much stronger
                    energy and goes hand in hand with being responsible for
                    creating your reality. The word decision comes from the Latin
                    word decidere, which means “to kill off any other alternatives.”
                    Choosing is better but not best.<br><br>
                    The third level of wanting is “I commit to being rich.” The
                    definition of the word commit is “to devote oneself unreservedly.” This means holding absolutely
                    nothing back; giving
                    100 percent of everything you’ve got to achieving wealth. It
                    means being willing to do whatever it takes for as long as it
                    takes. This is the warrior’s way. No excuses, no ifs, no buts, no
                    maybes—and failure is not an option. The warrior’s way is
                    simple: “I will be rich or I will die trying.”
                    “I commit to being rich.” Try saying that to yourself....
                    What comes up for you? For some, it feels empowering. For
                    others, it feels daunting.<br><br>
                    Most people would never truly commit to being rich. If you
                    asked them, “Would you bet your life that in the next
                    ten years you will be wealthy?” most would say, “No way!”
                    That’s the difference between rich people and poor people. It’s
                    precisely because people won’t truly commit to being rich that
                    they are not rich and most likely never will be.<br><br>
                    Some might say, “Harv, what are you talking about? I work
                    my butt off, I’m trying real hard. Of course I’m committed to
                    being rich.” And I would reply, “That you’re trying means
                    little. The definition of commitment is to devote oneself
                    unreservedly.” The key word is unreservedly. Which means
                    you’re putting everything, and I mean everything, you’ve got
                    into it. Most people I know who are not financially successful
                    have limits on how much they are willing to do, how much
                    they are willing to risk, and how much they are willing to
                    sacrifice. Although they think they’re willing to do whatever it
                    takes, upon deeper questioning I always find they have plenty
                    of conditions around what they are willing to do and not do to
                    succeed!<br><br>
                    I hate to have to be the one to tell you this, but getting rich
                    is not a stroll in the park, and anyone who tells you it is either
                    knows a heck of a lot more than me or is a little out of integrity. In my experience, getting rich
                    takes focus, courage,
                    knowledge, expertise, 100 percent of your effort, a never-giveup attitude, and of course a rich
                    mind-set. You also have to
                    believe in your heart of hearts that you can create wealth and
                    that you absolutely deserve it. Again, what this means is that, if
                    you are not fully, totally, and truly committed to creating
                    wealth, chances are you won’t.<br>

                <p>
                    Are you willing to work sixteen hours a day? Rich people
                    are. Are you willing to work seven days a week and give up
                    most of your weekends? Rich people are. Are you willing to
                    sacrifice seeing your family, your friends, and give up your
                    recreations and hobbies? Rich people are. Are you willing to
                    risk all your time, energy, and start-up capital with no guarantee of returns? Rich people
                    are.<br><br>
                    For a time, hopefully a short time but often a long time, rich
                    people are ready and willing to do all of the above. Are you?
                    Maybe you’ll be lucky and you won’t have to work long or
                    hard or sacrifice anything. You can wish for that, but I sure
                    wouldn’t count on it. Again, rich people are committed
                    enough to do whatever it takes. Period.<br><br>
                    It’s interesting to note, however, that once you do commit,
                    the universe will bend over backward to support you. One of
                    my favorite passages is by explorer W. H. Murray, who wrote
                    the following during one of the first Himalayan expeditions:<br><br>
                    Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back,
                    always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there
                    is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and
                    splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then
                    providence moves too. A whole stream of events issues from the decision,
                    raising in one’s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents, meetings, and
                    material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his
                    way.<br><br>
                    In other words, the universe will assist you, guide you,
                    support you, and even create miracles for you. But first, you
                    have to commit!<br>

                <h3>MILLIONAIRE MIND ACTIONS</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Write a short paragraph on exactly why creating wealth is
                    important to you. Be specific.<br><br>
                    2. Meet with a friend or family member who is willing to
                    support you. Tell that person you want to evoke the power of
                    commitment for the purpose of creating greater success. Put
                    your hand on your heart, look that person in the eye, and
                    repeat the following statement:<br><br>
                    “I, ____________ [your name], do hereby commit to
                    becoming a millionaire or more by ________ [date].”<br>
                    Tell your partner to say, “I believe in you.” Then you say,
                    “Thank you.”<br><br>
                    P.S. Check in as to how you feel before your com -
                    mitment and how you feel after it. If you feel a sense of
                    freedom, you’re on your way. If you feel a tinge of fear,
                    you’re on your way. If you didn’t bother doing it, you’re
                    still in “not being willing to do whatever it takes” mode
                    or “I don’t need to do any of this weird stuff ” mode.
                    Either way, let me remind you, your way has gotten you
                    exactly where you are right now.
