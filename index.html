                T.Harv Eker, and Why Should
                I Read This Book?”</h2>
            <article class="p-3">
                <p>People are shocked, at the beginning of my seminars, when
                    one of the first things I tell them is “Don’t believe a word I
                    say.” Why would I suggest that? Because I can only speak
                    from my own experience. None of the concepts and insights I
                    share are inherently true or false, right or wrong. They simply
                    reflect my own results, and the amazing results I’ve seen in the
                    lives of thousands and thousands of my students. Having said
                    that, however, I believe that if you use the principles you learn
                    in this book, you will totally transform your life. Don’t just
                    read this book. Study it as if your life depended on it. Then try
                    the principles out for yourself. Whatever works, keep doing.<br><br>
                    Whatever doesn’t, you’re welcome to throw away.
                    I know I may be biased, but when it comes to money, this
                    may be the most important book you have ever read. I understand that’s a bold statement, but the
                    fact is, this book
                    provides the missing link between your desire for success
                    and your achievement of success. As you’ve probably found
                    out by now, those are two different worlds.
                    No doubt you’ve read other books, listened to tapes or
                    CDs, gone to courses, and learned about numerous get-rich
                    systems be they in real estate, stocks, or business. But what
                    happened? For most people, not much! They get a short blast
                    of energy, and then it’s back to the status quo.
                    Finally, there’s an answer. It’s simple, it’s law, and you’re
                    not going to circumvent it. It all comes down to this: if your
                    subconscious “financial blueprint” is not “set” for success,
                    nothing you learn, nothing you know, and nothing you do will
                    make much of a difference.<br><br>
                    In the pages of this book, we will demystify for you why
                    some people are destined to be rich and others are destined for
                    a life of struggle. You will understand the root causes of
                    success, mediocrity, or financial failure and begin changing
                    your financial future for the better. You will understand how
                    childhood influences shape our financial blueprint and how
                    these influences can lead to self-defeating thoughts and habits.<br><br>
                    You will experience powerful declarations that will help you
                    replace your nonsupportive ways of thinking with mental
                    “wealth files” so that you think—and succeed—just as rich
                    people do. You will also learn practical, step-by-step strategies
                    for increasing your income and building wealth.<br><br>
                    In Part I of this book, we will explain how each of us is
                    conditioned to think and act when it comes to money, and
                    outline four key strategies for revising our mental money
                    blueprint. In Part II, we examine the differences between how
                    rich, middle-class, and poor people think, and provide
                    seventeen attitudes and actions to take that will lead to permanent changes in your financial life.
                    Throughout the book
                    “Who the Heck Is T. Harv Eker, and Why Should I Read This Book?” - 3
                    we also share just a few examples of the thousands of letters
                    and e-mails I’ve received from students who have attended the
                    Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar and achieved powerful
                    results in their lives.<br><br>
                    So what is my experience? Where am I coming from? Was I
                    always successful? I wish!<br><br>
                    Like many of you, I supposedly had a lot of “potential” but
                    had little to show for it. I read all the books, listened to all the
                    tapes, and went to all the seminars. I really, really, really
                    wanted to be successful. I don’t know whether it was for the
                    money, the freedom, the sense of achievement, or just to
                    prove I was good enough in my parents’ eyes, but I was almost
                    obsessed with becoming a “success.” During my twenties, I
                    started several different businesses, each with the dream of
                    making my fortune, but my results went from dismal to worse.<br><br>
                    I worked my butt off but kept coming up short. I had
                    “Loch Ness monster disease”: I had heard of this thing called
                    profit, I just never saw any of it. I kept thinking, “If I just get
                    into the right business, get on the right horse, I’ll make it.” But
                    I was wrong. Nothing was working...at least for me. And it was
                    the last part of that sentence that finally struck me. How come
                    others were succeeding in the exact same business I was in and
                    I was still broke? What happened to “Mr. Potential”?<br><br>
                    So I began doing some serious soul-searching. I examined
                    my true beliefs and saw that even though I said I really wanted
                    to be rich, I had some deep-rooted worries about it. Mostly I
                    was afraid. Afraid that I might fail, or worse, succeed and then
                    somehow lose it all. Then I’d really be a schmuck. Worse, I
                    would blow the one thing I had going for
                    me: my “story” that I had all this “potential.” What if I found
                    out I didn’t have what it took and I was destined to a life of
                    struggle?<br><br>
                    Then, as luck would have it, I got some advice from an
                    extremely rich friend of my father’s. He was at my parents’
                    house playing cards with the “boys” and, in passing, noticed
                    me. This was the third time I’d moved back home, and I was
                    living in the “lower-level suite,” otherwise known as the
                    basement. I suppose my dad had complained to him of my
                    woeful existence because when he saw me, he had the sympathy in his eyes usually reserved for the
                    bereaved at a funeral.
                    He said, “Harv, I started in the same way as you, a complete
                    disaster.” Great, I thought, this was making me feel a lot
                    better. I should let him know that I was busy...watch-ing the
                    paint peel off the wall.<br><br>
                    He kept going: “But then I got some advice that changed
                    my life, and I’d like to pass it on to you.” Oh, no, here comes
                    the father-son lecture, and he’s not even my father! Finally he
                    came out with it: “Harv, if you’re not doing as well as you’d
                    like, all that means is there’s something you don’t know.”<br><br>
                    Being a brash young man at the time, I thought I knew pretty
                    well everything, but alas, my bank account said something
                    different. So I finally began to listen. He continued, “Did you
                    know that most rich people think in very similar ways?”
                    I said, “No, I never really considered that.” To which he
                    replied, “It’s not an exact science, but for the most part, rich
                    people think a certain way and poor people think a completely
                    different way, and those ways of thinking determine their
                    actions and therefore determine their results.” He went on, “If
                    you thought the way rich people do and did what
                    “Who the Heck Is T. Harv Eker, and Why Should I Read This Book?” - 5
                    rich people do, do you believe you could become rich too?” I
                    remember answering with all the confidence of a mush ball, “I
                    think so.” “Then,” he replied, “all you have to do is copy how
                    rich people think.”<br><br>
                    Being the skeptic I was at the time, I said, “So what are you
                    thinking right now?” To which he replied, “I’m thinking that
                    rich people keep their commitments and mine is to your dad
                    right now. The guys are waiting for me, see ya.” Although he
                    walked out, what he said sank in.<br><br>
                    Nothing else was working in my life, so I figured what the
                    heck and threw myself wholeheartedly into studying rich
                    people and how they think. I learned everything I could about
                    the inner workings of the mind, but concentrated primarily on
                    the psychology of money and success. I discovered that it was
                    true: rich people really do think differently from poor and even
                    middle-class people. Eventually, I became aware of how my
                    own thoughts were holding me back from wealth. More
                    important, I learned several powerful techniques and strategies
                    to actually recondition my mind so that I would think in the
                    same ways rich people do.<br><br>
                    Finally, I said, “Enough yakking about it, let’s put it to the
                    test.” I decided to attempt yet another business. Because I was
                    really into health and exercise, I opened one of the first retail
                    fitness stores in North America. I didn’t have any money, so I
                    had to borrow $2,000 on my Visa card to get the business
                    started. I began using what I’d learned by modeling rich
                    people, both in terms of their business strategies and their
                    thinking strategies. The first thing I did was commit to my
                    success and playing to win. I swore I would focus and not
                    even consider leaving this business until I was a millionaire or
                    more. this was radically different from my previous efforts,
                    where, because I always thought short-term, I would
                    constantly get sidetracked by either good opportunities or
                    when things got tough.<br><br>
                    I also began challenging my mental approach whenever I
                    began thinking in financially negative or counterproductive
                    ways. In the past, I believed that what my mind said was truth.<br><br>
                    I learned that in many ways, my mind was my biggest obstacle
                    to success. I chose not to entertain thoughts that did not
                    empower me toward my vision of wealth. I used every one of
                    the principles you are going to learn in this book. Did it work?
                    Boy, did it work!<br><br>
                    The business was so successful that I opened ten stores in
                    only two and a half years. I then sold half the company shares
                    to a Fortune 500 company for $1.6 million.<br><br>
                    After that, I moved to sunny San Diego. I took a couple of
                    years off to refine my strategies and began doing one-on-one
                    business consulting. I presume it was quite effective for people
                    because they kept bringing friends, partners, and associates to
                    our sessions. Soon I was coaching ten and sometimes twenty
                    people at a time.<br><br>
                    One of my clients suggested that I might as well open up a
                    school. I thought that was a great idea, so I did. I founded the
                    Street Smart Business School and taught thousands of people
                    all across North America “street-smart” business strategies for
                    “high-speed” success.<br><br>
                    As I traveled across the continent giving my seminars, I
                    noticed something strange: You could have two people sitting
                    side by side in exactly the same room, learning exactly the
                    same principles and strategies. One person would take these
                    tools and skyrocket to success. But what do you think might
                    happen to the person sitting right next to him or her? The
                    answer is, not much!<br><br>
                    That’s when it became obvious that you can have the
                    “Who the Heck Is T. Harv Eker, and Why Should I Read This Book?” - 7
                    greatest “tools” in the world, but if you’ve got a tiny leak in
                    your “toolbox” (I’m pointing to my head right now), you’ve
                    got a problem. So I designed a program called the Millionaire
                    Mind Intensive based on the inner game of money and
                    success. When I combined the inner game (the toolbox) with
                    the outer game (the tools), virtually everybody’s results went
                    through the roof! So that’s what you’re going to learn in this
                    book: how to master the inner game of money to win the
                    game of money—how to think rich to get rich!<br><br>
                    People often ask me whether my success was a “one-shot
                    deal” or whether it has continued. Let me put it this way:
                    Using the exact principles I teach, I have now earned millions
                    and millions of dollars and am a multimultimillionaire several
                    times over. Virtually all my investments and business ventures
                    seem to skyrocket! Some people tell me I have the “Midas
                    touch,” where everything I get involved in turns to gold.<br><br>
                    They’re right, but what they may not realize is that having a
                    Midas touch is simply another way of saying, having a
                    “financial blueprint” set for success, which is exactly what you
                    will have once you learn these principles and do this work.<br><br>
                    Early on during our Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, I
                    generally ask the audience, “How many of you came here to
                    learn?” It’s a bit of a trick question because as author Josh
                    Billings said, “It’s not what we don’t know that prevents us
                    from succeeding; it’s what we know that just ain’t so that is our
                    greatest obstacle.” This book is not as much about learning as
                    it is about “unlearning”! It is essential you recognize how your
                    old ways of thinking and acting have gotten you exactly where
                    you are right now.<br><br>
                    If you’re really rich and really happy, fine. But if you’re not,
                    I invite you to consider some possibilities that may not
                    fit into your “box” of what you currently think is right or even
                    appropriate for you.<br><br>
                    Even though I suggest that you “don’t believe a word I say”
                    and want you to test these concepts out in your own life, I’m
                    going to ask you to trust the ideas you are reading. Not
                    because you know me personally, but because thousands and
                    thousands of people have already changed their lives as a result
                    of the principles in this book.<br><br>
                    Speaking of trust, it reminds me of one of my favorite stories. It’s about a man who is walking
                    along a cliff and all of a
                    sudden loses his balance, slips, and falls off. Fortunately, he
                    has the presence of mind to grab on to the ledge, and he’s
                    hanging there for dear life. He hangs and hangs and finally
                    yells out, “Is there anybody up there who can help me?”
                    There’s no answer. He keeps calling and calling, “Is there
                    anybody up there who can help me?” Finally this big bellowing
                    voice calls back, “This is God. I can help you. Just let go and
                    trust.” Next thing you hear: “Is there anybody else up there
                    who can help me?”<br><br>
                    The lesson is simple. If you want to move to a higher level
                    of life, you have to be willing to let go of some of your old
                    ways of thinking and being and adopt new ones. The results
                    will eventually speak for themselves.<br><br>
